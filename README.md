# vue-app

> A test app to experiment with vue

## Building Modules

You can place everything in the same .vue file or linking the src to their specific tag

```
<script src="path/to/file"></script>
```

is exactly the same as 

```
<script>
  *insert here awesome code*
</script>
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
